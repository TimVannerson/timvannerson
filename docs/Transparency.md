# Transparency
Higher levels of transparency improve almost all aspects of life.

Transparency boosts trust and accountability in all types of relationships, reducing miscommunication and fostering innovative problem-solving. In technical systems, it also increases explainability.

When establishing or assessing transparency, consider codification both culturally (e.g. mission statements) and technically (e.g. public VCS. Repos).
