# Frameworks
Whether you call them frameworks, mental models, heuristics, protocols, principles, core beliefs, or something else, most of us have a set of cognitive shortcuts we rely on, either consciously or otherwise.

I believe that by [intentionally](Intention.md) bringing awareness to our own mental models, constantly curating them, and reflecting on when/how they differ from others, we will be more effective and less conflicted in our day-to-day lives.

I also believe that being [transparent](Transparency.md) about our convictions gives us the best opportunity to improve both our principles and hopefully others' as well.
